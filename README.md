This is a standard supervised classification task.A classification problem where we have to predict whether a loan would be approved or not. In a classification problem, we have to predict discrete values based on a given set of independent variable(s).Classification can be of two types:

Supervised: The labels are included in the training data and the goal is to train a model to learn to predict the labels from the features.

Binary Classification : In this classification we have to predict either of the two given classes. For example: classifying the gender as male or female, predicting the result as win or loss, etc.

Multiclass Classification : Here we have to classify the data into three or more classes. For example: classifying a movie's genre as comedy, action or romantic, classify fruits as oranges, apples, or pears, etc.

Loan prediction is a very common real-life problem that each retail bank faces atleast once in its lifetime. If done correctly, it can save a lot of man hours at the end of a retail bank.
